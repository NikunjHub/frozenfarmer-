        <h2>Fighting Food Waste</h2>
        <p>At The Frozen Farmer, we believe that every piece of fruit has value — even the ones that don’t look picture-perfect. That’s why we use “imperfect” fruits that grocery stores would reject and turn them into delicious desserts instead of letting them go to waste.</p>

        <h2>What is Imperfect Produce?</h2>
        <p>Imperfect produce refers to fruits and vegetables that are too small, oddly shaped, or slightly blemished. They’re just as tasty and nutritious — but often get discarded. We give them a second chance at life in every scoop.</p>

        <h2>Locally Grown, Minimally Processed</h2>
        <p>We grow much of our fruit right on our family farm in Bridgeville, Delaware, and source additional produce locally whenever possible. Our frozen treats are made with simple, farm-fresh ingredients and without artificial preservatives.</p>

        <h2>From Farm to Freezer with Purpose</h2>
        <p>Every cup of The Frozen Farmer sorbet or Frobert™ is a small step toward a more sustainable food system. By choosing us, you’re not just enjoying a treat — you’re supporting a future where less food is wasted and more is cherished.</p>
