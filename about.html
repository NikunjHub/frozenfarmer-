        <h2>From Farm to Freezer</h2>
        <p>The Frozen Farmer was founded on our third-generation family farm in Bridgeville, Delaware. We saw an opportunity to fight food waste by using perfectly imperfect fruits—fruits that are just as delicious but not pretty enough for grocery stores—and turn them into something magical: frozen desserts!</p>

        <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
        <p>Katey Evans, a farmer’s wife and mom, combined her passion for farming and culinary creativity to launch The Frozen Farmer. With support from her family and community, the idea blossomed into a nationally recognized brand that’s making dessert more sustainable.</p>

        <h2>Making Waves on Shark Tank</h2>
        <p>In 2020, Katey pitched The Frozen Farmer on ABC’s <strong>Shark Tank</strong> and scored a deal with Lori Greiner! Since then, the brand has skyrocketed into grocery stores across the country.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>We’re more than just a sweet treat — we’re a mission to reduce food waste and deliver healthy, wholesome, delicious desserts made from real ingredients, right from our farm.</p>
